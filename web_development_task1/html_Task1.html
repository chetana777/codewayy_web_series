    <p>There are <strong>leaders</strong> and there are those who lead. Leaders
        hold a position of power or influence. Those who lead
        inspire us.</p>
        
        <p></p>Whether individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead
        not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those
        who lead not for them, but for ourselves.</p>
        <p></p>This is a book for those who want to inspire others and for those
        who want to find someone to inspire them.</p>
